# Analysis of Standardized Test Results

This author was tasked with analyzing school district standardized test results using Python, the Pandas library, and Jupyter Notebook.

This analysis contains:
* a dataframe of the district's high schools' key metrics
* a dataframe of the key metrics of each school and test score analyses of each school by grade
* an analysis of test scores based on spending ranges per student
* an analysis of test scores based on school size
* an analysis of test scores based on school type (district or charter)

Some key findings:
* Spending more per student does not yield better test results or a greater percent of students passing.
* Larger schools have lower test results and a lower percent of students passing than small and medium schools.
* Charter schools significantly outperform district schools.
